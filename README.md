# Lovely Tasks — Task Manager App (Starter)

This is a starter React + Vite + Tailwind project for the **Task Manager** assignment.

## Features
- Add / complete / delete tasks
- Filter tasks (All / Active / Completed)
- Search tasks
- Light / Dark theme with context and persisted preference
- Tasks persisted in `localStorage`
- Modern UI with subtle animations (Tailwind)

## Setup
1. Ensure Node.js v18+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The app runs at `http://localhost:5173` by default (Vite).

## Notes
- Tailwind is already configured (see `tailwind.config.cjs`).
- This starter focuses on the front-end; feel free to expand features (drag-drop ordering, due dates, reminder notifications, API sync).

Enjoy — and if you want, I can push extra polish (animations, icons, deploy config) next.
